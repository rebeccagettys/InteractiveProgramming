The following game is an arrow-key controlled version of snake or Pacman
in which the large yellow polka dot must be aligned with the most amount of
 smaller dots (which correlate with point values based on color and size) to
  get the most points in the shortest amount of time! The arrow keys can be
  pressed once to move a short distance in one direction, or for a length of
  time to move toward a ball (or polka dot.) The timer will display the
  amount of time remaining in seconds, and the "Points:" displays the score.
The screen can be adjusted based on preference without affecting the rest of the game.
The final score will be displayed at the end of the game. If you'd like to play make
    sure that you have pygame and random modules installed. Download, run and press control
    b to play the game.
